This directory stores past news items that were moved from the “Latest News” section of `readme.md`.

## Maintenance Rules

- `readme.md` keeps only the latest three news items.
- Older news items from the fourth onward are moved to `docs/en/news/YYYYMMDD-<slug>.md`.
- When moving an item, add a reverse-chronological link in this `index.md`.

## List (newest first)

- No moved news items are currently archived.
