This directory stores past news items that were moved from the “Latest News” section of `README.md`.

## Maintenance Rules

- `README.md` keeps only the latest three news items.
- Older news items from the fourth onward are appended to a major-version file (for example, `docs/en/news/v0-releases.md`).
- When a new major version starts, create a new aggregate file (for example, `v1-releases.md`).
- When moving an item, add a reverse-chronological link in this `index.md`.

## List (newest first)

- [v0 Release Series](./v0-releases.md) (`v0.6.0` / `v0.5.0` / `v0.4.0` / `v0.3.0` / `v0.2.0` / `v0.1.0`)
